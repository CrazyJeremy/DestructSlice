saberThing Public Release Notes:

Assets/BLINDED_AM_ME package:
  - this old publicly available package contains MeshCut, the main cutting mechanic. It is heavily modified to incorporate a sort of asyncronous behavior to reduce the cpu load on a per-frame basis i.e. limit the amount of work to keep framerates high in vr

cleanup notes:

keep tripod and walking dpbot as examples to give people an idea on how to use animated characters
